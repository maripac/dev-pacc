			"quote":"here was a table in the middle of the room, plain chairs lined up on the walls, and at one end, a large map marked with all the colors of the rainbow. There was a vast amount of red on the map, which was good to see because it meant that something good was happening in those places. There was a lot of blue, a little green, some smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch showing where happy pioneers were drinking lager. But I wasn’t going to any of those places. I was going into the yellow. It was dead in the center of the map. And the river was there, as fascinating and deadly as a snake." ,
